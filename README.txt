I used the Hacker News API. This is just a project I made for myself to practice on my Android App Development skills.
Do let me know if you have any feedback. I intend to move on to actually projecting announcements with the home page by linking it to a proper database.
The Hacker News portion is to check if I am able to download data and display it properly in the app. The messaging system does not work yet and I am
still currently working on it, trying to find a good way to facilitate multiple chatrooms.
